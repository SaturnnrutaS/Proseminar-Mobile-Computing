  abstract = { Objective: This article provides an overview of tactile displays. Its goal is to assist human factors practitioners in deciding when and how to employ the sense of touch for the purpose of information representation. The article also identifies important research needs in this area. Background: First attempts to utilize the sense of touch as a medium for communication date back to the late 1950s. For the next 35 years progress in this area was relatively slow, but recent years have seen a surge in the interest and development of tactile displays and the integration of tactile signals in multimodal interfaces. A thorough understanding of the properties of this sensory channel and its interaction with other modalities is needed to ensure the effective and robust use of tactile displays. Methods: First, an overview of vibrotactile perception is provided. Next, the design of tactile displays is discussed with respect to available technologies. The potential benefit of including tactile cues in multimodal interfaces is discussed. Finally, research needs in the area of tactile information presentation are highlighted. Results: This review provides human factors researchers and interface designers with the requisite knowledge for creating effective tactile interfaces. It describes both potential benefits and limitations of this approach to information presentation. Conclusion: The sense of touch represents a promising means of supporting communication and coordination in human-human and human-machine systems. Application: Tactile interfaces can support numerous functions, including spatial orientation and guidance, attention management, and sensory substitution, in a wide range of domains. },

Methods: Event-related brain potentials were recorded in response to visual and auditory stimuli at attended and unattended locations. In the ‘Attend Same’ condition, attention was directed to a single location in both modalities, while in the ‘Attend Opposite’ condition, visual and auditory attention had to be directed into opposite directions. Results: Sensory-specific effects of attention on visual and auditory ERPs reflecting attentional modulations of perceptual processing were obtained in the ‘Attend Same’ condition, but not the ‘Attend Opposite’ condition. Beyond 200 ms post-stimulus, attentional ERP effects were also found in the ‘Attend Opposite’ condition. Conclusion: Results are inconsistent with the view that spatially selective processing is controlled by independent modality-specific systems. Effects of spatial attention on visual and auditory perceptual processing are closely linked, suggesting the existence of a supramodal attentional control system. At post-perceptual levels, attentional control may be more flexible.},

This phenomenon is known aschange blindness in vision. A similar phenomenon occurs in audition, but to date no such effect has been documented in touch. In the present study, we explored the ability of people to detect changes introduced between two consecutively presented vibrotactile patterns presented over the body surface. The patterns consisted of two or three vibrotactile stimuli presented for 200 msec. The position of one of the vibrotactile stimuli composing the display was repeatedly changed (alternating between two different positions) on 50{\%} of the trials, but the same pattern was presented repeatedly on the remaining trials. Three conditions were investigated: No interval between the patterns, an empty interval between the patterns, and a masked interval between the patterns. Change detection was near perfect in the no-interval block. Performance deteriorated somewhat in the empty-interval block, but by far the worst change detection performance occurred in the masked-interval block. These results demonstrate that ``change blindness'' can also affect tactile perception.},

When the 0 was left uncertain about which finger(s) would be presented a signal on any given trial, a result having the appearance of spatial summation was obtained. Theappearance is misleading;the difference between two-finger and one-finger sensitivity in this case reflects, instead, a decrement in the performance of the single fingers.

  abstract = { The validity of d', the signal detection theory measure of sensory efficiency, seems suspect in applications to vigilance and inspection, and it is suggested that the investigator should use an alternative, distribution-free measure instead. Three nonparametric measures of efficiency which seem particularly well suited to vigilance applications are considered. The measures, AG (Green and Swets, 1966), A' (Pollack and Norman, 1964), and E (McCornack, 1961) are defined and illustrated, and an example is provided demonstrating their use and suitability in analyzing data from a sustained monitoring task. Norman's (1964) nonmetric procedure for comparing performance efficiency is also applied to the data and is shown to provide a useful means for distinguishing between measure-dependent and measure-independent inferences about changes in efficiency. The relative merits of the three non-parametric measures are discussed. },
